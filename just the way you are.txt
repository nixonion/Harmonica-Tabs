When I see your face,
6        7 -8   8    -8  7  -8     7
there's not a thing that I would change.
6     7 7   -8  8  -8
Cause you're a-ma-zing,
-9    8   7  -8   7
just the way you are.

6     7   -8   8
And when you smile,
6     7    -8     8   -8    7     7  -8   7
the whole world stops and stares for a-while.
-6     7      7   -8  8  -8
Cause girl, you're a-ma-zing,
-9    8   7  -8   7
just the way you are.
